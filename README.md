## Tips

* Check out [this](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/) clever explanation by css-tricks for more in detail
* If you're unsure about props.children — [this](https://learn.co/lessons/react-this-props-children) article is good at explaining the concept behind children props in React. ✌️

## What are some of the key features a rich text editor has? Hmm — let's see (some of this is still being worked-on):

* Images
* Headers
* Code highlighting
* Embedded Videos
* Text formatting (alignment, bullet list, ordered list, etc) (integrating the wmira [react-icons-kit](https://github.com/wmira/react-icons-kit) package)
* Save the text to a database for safe keeping
* Links
